# person1 = ("smith", 35, "lagos")
# (name, age, location) = person1
# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(location)

# 1.Write a Python function to check if a given tuple is empty.
# way1
# name_tuple = ()
# if len(name_tuple) == 0:
#     print("this tuple is empty")
# else:
#     print("there is at least one tuple")
# way2
# if name_tuple:
#     print("true")
# else:
#     print("false")

# 2. Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple.
# tuple_name = ("rat", "birds", "goat", "cow")
# print(len(tuple_name))

# 3. Write a Python program to reverse a tuple.
# tuple_name = ("rats", "birds", "goats", "cows")
# print(tuple_name[::-1])

# 4. Write a Python function to check if a given element exists in a tuple.
# tuple_name = ("rats", "birds", "goats", "cows")
# if "rat" in tuple_name:
#     print("yes")
# else:
#     print("no")


# 5. Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a list.
# tuple_name = ("rats", "birds", "goats", "cows")
# tuplelist = list(tuple_name)
# print(type(tuplelist))
# print(tuplelist)

# 6. Write a Python program to find the maximum and minimum elements in a tuple.
# tuple_num1 = (2, 23, 500, 3, 17, 43, 55, 89)
# print(max(tuple_num1))
# print(min(tuple_num1))

# 7. Write a Python program to concatenate two tuples.
# tuple1 = ("i", "want", 2)
# tuple2 = ("learn", "python")
# print(tuple1 + tuple2)

# 8. Find the sum of all elements in the numbers tuple.
# tuple_num1 = (2, 23, 500, 3, 17, 43, 55, 89)
# print(sum(tuple_num1))

# 9. Write a Python program to remove an element from a tuple.

# A tuple is immutable, meaning that objects inside it cannot be changed.

# 10. Write a Python program to find the index of a particular element in a tuple.
# tuple_name = ("rats", "birds", "goats", "cows")
# print(tuple_name.index("birds"))
